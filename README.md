A self-hosted BitTorrent tracker information and DMCA/abuse report management system. Built with PHP and MySQL — no frameworks, no dependencies, no build step.

Compatible with [erdgeist OpenTracker](https://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/) and any other tracker software that uses a newline-separated text file for blacklisting info hashes. Point the blacklist file path in admin settings to your tracker's blacklist file and the application manages entries automatically.

Provides a public-facing website for tracker information, abuse report submission, report status checking, block checking, appeal management, and a full-featured admin panel with email notifications.

---

## Features

### Public Pages
- **Home** — tracker announce URLs, features overview, donation links, contact info
- **Submit a Report** — DMCA/abuse report form with info hash extraction from magnet links, optional additional message
- **Check Report Status** — look up report status by report number or info hash + email (privacy-safe: requires email match)
- **Block Check** — verify if an info hash is currently blocked on the tracker (never reveals whether reports exist)
- **Appeal System** — submit appeals to request blocking or unblocking of info hashes
- **Transparency Page** — public statistics showing aggregated block counts per organization
- **Terms of Service** — configurable ToS page

### Admin Panel
- **Dashboard** — sortable tables with multi-level sorting, search, filtering, pagination
- **Report Workflow** — pending → reviewed → blocked/archived, with inline editing for company/entity fields
- **Appeal Management** — accept/reject appeals with optional admin response, auto-close related appeals
- **Blacklist Integration** — block/unblock info hashes via newline-separated blacklist file, with path validation
- **Tracker Restart + Smart Recommendations** — optional one-click `systemctl restart` of your tracker service (password-confirmed), with orange/red hints that surface when a restart is due after blacklist changes or a long uptime — see [OpenTracker service restart](#opentracker-service-restart)
- **Email Notifications** — professional dark-themed HTML emails for all status changes, with per-type unsubscribe
- **Auto-Archiving** — automatically archive old reviewed reports and resolved appeals after configurable days
- **Settings** — all configuration via web UI (site info, reCAPTCHA, CAPTCHA tuning, donations, footer, etc.)

### Email System
- **Submission Confirmation** — sent when a report is filed
- **Under Review** — sent when an admin first opens a report
- **Status Updates** — sent on every status change (reviewed, blocked, archived, restored)
- **Custom Messages** — admin can send freeform messages to reporters
- **Appeal Confirmation** — sent when an appeal is submitted
- **Appeal Decision** — sent when an appeal is accepted/rejected, with colored status and object title
- **Notification Preferences** — users can manage per-type email preferences via HMAC-secured link
- **One-Click Unsubscribe** — RFC 8058 compliant `List-Unsubscribe-Post` header for Gmail/Yahoo

### Security
- **Smart CAPTCHA** — point-based reCAPTCHA v2 system with modal overlay; CAPTCHA only appears after configurable activity threshold, with grace period after solving
- **CSRF Protection** — token validation on all public form submissions and on every admin write (via the `X-CSRF-Token` header)
- **Login Hardening** — per-IP brute-force lockout on admin login (attempts + window now admin-configurable) + constant-time username/password comparison
- **Admin Session Timeouts** — idle timeout and absolute lifetime cap; an expired session is destroyed server-side so a stale cookie can't be reused
- **Rate Limiting** — per-IP throttling on report submission **and** on status checks, block lookups and appeal submissions (all admin-tunable, `0` = off), plus a duplicate-appeal guard
- **Prepared Statements** — all database queries use PDO with parameterized queries; dynamic `ORDER BY`/table names are whitelisted
- **Input Sanitization** — `htmlspecialchars` on all output, server-side validation on all input; untrusted upstream stats data is escaped before it touches the DOM
- **Password Hashing** — bcrypt via `password_hash()`
- **HMAC Tokens** — SHA-256 signed unsubscribe links with timing-safe comparison
- **No Secrets in Source** — DB credentials are injected by the installer or via `DB_HOST`/`DB_NAME`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASS` environment variables; nothing sensitive is committed
- **Generic Error Responses** — raw database/exception messages are logged server-side, never returned to clients
- **Directory Protection** — `.htaccess` deny rules on `config/`, `includes/`, `templates/`, `api/`, `sql/`, `tests/`, `.claude/`; `assets/` blocks server-side script execution and directory listing (see [Reverse proxy / Nginx](#reverse-proxy--nginx-notes) for non-Apache servers)
- **Security Headers** — `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`
- **Subresource Integrity** — pinned CDN assets (Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons) loaded with `integrity` hashes
- **Reverse-Proxy Aware** — optional trusted-proxy allow-list + configurable client-IP header so per-IP limits work correctly behind Cloudflare / nginx without opening a spoofing hole
- **Information Leak Prevention** — generic responses for not-found queries, email always required for status checks

### Donations
- **Custom Fields** — up to 15 donation fields with custom labels
- **Smart Display** — URLs (http/https) render as clickable links; wallet addresses/hashes render as copyable code blocks
- **Backward Compatible** — auto-migrates from legacy BTC/ETH/XMR fields

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.0+** with extensions: `pdo_mysql`, `json`, `openssl`, `mbstring`
- **MySQL 5.7+** or **MariaDB 10.3+**
- **Apache** with `mod_rewrite` enabled (for Nginx see [Reverse proxy / Nginx notes](#reverse-proxy--nginx-notes))
- **PHP `mail()` function** — for email notifications (or configure a local MTA)
- *(Optional)* **APCu** — if the `apcu` extension is present, site settings are cached across requests to avoid a settings query on every hit; the app works fine without it

---

## Installation

### 1. Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TryHackX/tracker.git
cd tracker
```

Or download and extract the ZIP from GitHub releases.

### 2. Upload

Upload all files to your web server document root or a subdirectory.

> **Do not upload runtime state.** The app writes several files into `config/` while running —
> `stats_cache.json`, `stats_fetch.lock`, `rate_limits.json`, `login_attempts.json`, `*.marker`.
> These are machine-local; never copy them from a dev machine to production (a stale
> `stats_fetch.lock` will wedge the stats endpoint on "Syncing Swarms…" — see Troubleshooting).
> They are already in `.gitignore`, so a `git`-based deploy skips them automatically; if you upload
> by FTP, exclude them. Also delete any `*.orig`/`*.bak` backups (e.g. `hash.txt.orig` leaks the
> admin password hash).

### 3. Set Permissions

The `config/` directory **must be writable by the web-server user** — the app persists the shared
stats cache, its fetch lock, and rate-limit/login-throttle state there at runtime. If it isn't
writable, stats never refresh and rate limiting silently fails open.

```bash
# Linux with Apache/Nginx + php-fpm (adjust user:group to your PHP process, often www-data)
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data config/
sudo chmod 775 config/
```

Find out which user PHP runs as with `<?php echo exec('whoami'); ?>` or check your php-fpm pool
config. On shared hosting where PHP runs as your account user, the files just need to be owned by
that account (typically `755` on the directory is enough). Avoid `777`.

### 4. Configure RewriteBase

Edit `.htaccess` and set `RewriteBase` to match your installation path:

```apache
# If installed at domain root:
RewriteBase /

# If installed in a subdirectory:
RewriteBase /tracker/
```

### 5. Run the Installer

Navigate to `https://your-domain.com/install.php` in your browser.

**Step 1 — Environment Check**
- Verifies PHP version, required extensions, and directory permissions

**Step 2 — Database**
- Enter MySQL credentials (database will be created automatically if it doesn't exist)
- Creates all required tables

**Step 3 — Site & Admin Settings**
- Admin username and password (min 10 characters, must include upper- and lower-case letters, a digit and a symbol)
- Site name, URL, and contact email
- Tracker announce URLs (HTTP/S and UDP)
- reCAPTCHA v2 keys (optional — get them from [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin))
- Blacklist file path (with Test button to verify permissions)

**Step 4 — Complete**
- Click **"Delete install.php"** to remove the installer for security
- If you skip this step, delete `install.php` manually from the server

### 6. Configure Your Tracker

Point your tracker software's blacklist file to the path configured in step 3. For OpenTracker, this is the `-b` flag:

```bash
opentracker -b /path/to/blacklist
```

The application writes one info hash per line (lowercase hex, 40 characters). When you block a hash through the admin panel, it's appended to this file. When you unblock, it's removed.

## Configuration

All settings are managed through **Admin Panel → Settings** (`/?action=admin` → Settings icon):

| Section | Settings |
|---------|----------|
| **Site Configuration** | Site name, URL, announce URLs (HTTP/S + UDP), GitHub URL |
| **Contact & Email** | Site email, contact visibility, email obfuscation, HMAC secret |
| **reCAPTCHA v2** | Enable/disable globally and per-context (report, login, status, appeals, block check) |
| **Smart CAPTCHA** | Point threshold, grace period, points per action type |
| **Public Pages** | Auto-archive days for reports and appeals |
| **Rate Limits & Blacklist** | Reports/status-checks/block-lookups/appeals per hour (per IP), items per page, message length limits, blacklist file path with test |
| **Admin Sessions & Proxy** | Session idle timeout, absolute session cap, login lockout attempts/window, trusted proxy IPs, client IP header |
| **Donation Fields** | Enable/disable, custom label+value fields (max 15), auto-detects URLs vs addresses |
| **Transparency** | Enable/disable, results per page |
| **Tracker Statistics** | Enable, source URL, home/page refresh intervals, **cache lifetime (TTL)**, request timeout, loading delays, peer-label style — see [Tracker statistics & caching](#tracker-statistics--caching) |
| **OpenTracker Service** | systemd unit name, sudo toggle, restart-recommendation thresholds — see [OpenTracker service restart](#opentracker-service-restart) |
| **Footer** | Copyright year, brand/tracker software/OS elements with names and URLs |
| **Security & Credentials** | Admin username, password change (separate form) |

### Smart CAPTCHA

The CAPTCHA system uses activity points instead of showing CAPTCHA on every request:

1. Each user action adds configurable points to the session (e.g., submit report = 2 pts, status check = 1 pt)
2. CAPTCHA only appears when accumulated points reach the threshold (default: 6)
3. After solving, a grace period (default: 5 minutes) bypasses all CAPTCHAs
4. Failed admin login always resets grace and sets points to threshold
5. CAPTCHA renders in a modal overlay — form data is preserved

### Email Notification Preferences

Users receive a "Manage notification preferences" link in every email footer. The preferences page allows per-type control:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Submission Confirmations | Confirmation after submitting a report |
| Under Review | Notification when admin starts reviewing |
| Status Updates | Changes to report status (reviewed, blocked, archived) |
| Admin Messages | Custom messages from the admin team |
| Appeal Notifications | Appeal confirmations and decision emails |

A master toggle disables/enables all at once.

### Tracker statistics & caching

The tracker stats (home widget + `/?action=stats` page) are fetched from an upstream OpenTracker
`stats` endpoint, which can be slow (tens of seconds under load). To keep this fast and to avoid
every visitor triggering their own fetch, the data is cached **server-side** and shared by everyone:

- **One shared cache** (`config/stats_cache.json`). The first visitor whose cache has expired
  triggers a single upstream fetch under an exclusive lock (`config/stats_fetch.lock`); everyone
  else is served the existing cached data and polls until the fresh copy lands. One fetch, many
  readers — even with 50 people on the page at once.
- **Cache Lifetime / TTL** (`tracker_stats_cache_ttl`, default **60s**) is the shared server-side
  lifetime of the data and is **decoupled** from the client refresh intervals. While the cache is
  younger than the TTL, reloads and polls are cheap cache hits and the upstream is **not** re-fetched.
  Set the TTL **≥ your real upstream fetch time** (often 90–120s) so slow fetches don't cause
  constant re-syncing.
- **Home / Stats-page refresh intervals** only control how often each browser re-checks the shared
  cache; they no longer decide when the upstream is fetched.
- **Request Timeout** (`tracker_stats_timeout`) bounds the upstream fetch. PHP's execution limit is
  derived from it automatically, so raising the timeout no longer causes the fetch to be killed
  mid-flight (the cause of the earlier "stats never load" behaviour).
- **Live Syncs counter** (`tracker_stats_livesync_mode`): OpenTracker's own `livesync` value is `0`
  on single-node setups. Set this to *"Count our cache refreshes"* (Admin → Settings → Tracker
  Statistics) to repurpose the **Live Syncs** stat as the number of times the cache has been
  refreshed since the tracker last started. It auto-resets to 1 when a tracker restart is detected
  (the reported uptime drops well below the previous reading). `upstream` (default) keeps the raw value.

> Optional: instead of relying on visitor traffic to refresh the cache, you can run a cron job that
> hits the endpoint periodically, e.g. `*/2 * * * * curl -s 'https://your-domain/api.php?endpoint=tracker_stats&source=home' >/dev/null`.
> Combined with a longer TTL this makes visitors *always* hit a warm cache.

### OpenTracker service restart

OpenTracker reads its blacklist file **only at startup**, so a blocked/unblocked hash doesn't take
effect until the tracker is restarted. To make that a one-click operation — and to nudge you when
it's due — set **Admin → Settings → OpenTracker Service → Service name** to your systemd unit
(e.g. `opentracker` or `opentracker.service`). When set:

- A **Restart tracker** button appears in the Dashboard header. It runs `systemctl restart <name>`
  on the server (password-confirmed) and clears the pending-change tracking on success.
- **Smart recommendations** appear as a warning chip next to the button. Hover (or tap on mobile)
  to see the full list; the button's glow and the chip colour reflect the highest active severity.
  Warnings stack and are configurable:
  - **Blacklist changed since last start** — orange once pending changes reach *Blacklist → orange*
    (default **1**), red at *Blacklist → red* (default **5**). "Pending" is measured against the
    tracker's boot time (from the stats cache uptime), so it self-clears the moment the tracker
    restarts — whether from the panel or from the shell.
  - **Long uptime** — orange at *Uptime → orange* days (default **14**), red at *Uptime → red*
    (default **30**). Requires Tracker Statistics to be enabled (that's where uptime comes from).

Leave the service name empty to hide the button and chip entirely.

**Server permission (required).** php-fpm runs unprivileged, so grant it permission to run just that
one command via sudo (keep **Run via sudo = Yes**):

```bash
# adjust the user (php-fpm user, often www-data) and unit name to match your box
echo 'www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart opentracker' \
  | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/tracker-restart
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/tracker-restart
```

The service name is validated against a strict systemd-unit whitelist and passed through
`escapeshellarg`, so it can't be used to inject a second command. If PHP's `exec()` is disabled the
button is greyed out with an explanatory note. On failure the exact `systemctl`/sudo output is shown
so you can fix the sudoers rule.

### Reverse proxy / Nginx notes

The bundled `.htaccess` files (URL rewriting, directory `deny`, security headers) are **Apache only**.
On **Nginx** you must replicate two things in your server config:

```nginx
# 1. Never serve the private directories (equivalent of the deny-all .htaccess files)
location ~ ^/(config|includes|templates|api|sql|tests|\.claude)/ { deny all; return 404; }
location ~* \.(orig|bak|sql|log|lock|marker)$ { deny all; return 404; }

# 2. Front-controller routing
location /api/ { rewrite ^/api/(.*)$ /api.php?endpoint=$1 last; }
location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?action=$request_uri; }
```

Also port the security headers from `.htaccess` into an `add_header` block, and **delete
`install.php`** after setup.

**Behind Cloudflare / a reverse proxy:** by default the app uses the raw connection IP
(`REMOTE_ADDR`), which will be the proxy — so all visitors would share one IP for rate limiting. Set
**Admin → Settings → Admin Sessions & Proxy → Trusted proxy IPs** to your proxy addresses and
**Client IP header** to the header it sets (e.g. `CF-Connecting-IP` or `X-Forwarded-For`). The
forwarded header is trusted **only** when the request actually originates from a listed proxy.

> **Note on CSP:** the Content-Security-Policy in `.htaccess` intentionally allows `'unsafe-inline'`
> / `'unsafe-eval'` because the pages use inline `onclick` handlers and Google reCAPTCHA. If you
> refactor those out (or self-host reCAPTCHA), tighten the policy with nonces/hashes.

## Database Schema

The installer creates the following tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `settings` | Key-value store for all site configuration |
| `reports` | Active abuse reports |
| `archives` | Archived (closed) reports |
| `appeals` | Active appeals (block/unblock requests) |
| `appeal_archives` | Archived (resolved) appeals |
| `sent_emails` | Log of all sent email notifications |
| `unsubscribed_emails` | Legacy full-unsubscribe list |
| `email_preferences` | Per-email, per-type notification preferences |

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** PHP 8.x — no framework, single entry point routing (`index.php` for pages, `api.php` for API)
- **Database:** MySQL/MariaDB with PDO (prepared statements, FETCH_ASSOC mode)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (no build step), Bootstrap 5 (CDN) for admin panel, custom dark theme CSS for public pages
- **Email:** PHP `mail()` with multipart MIME (HTML + plain text), dark-themed templates
- **Icons:** Bootstrap Icons (CDN, admin panel only)
- **CAPTCHA:** Google reCAPTCHA v2 (explicit render mode, modal overlay)

---

## API Reference

All API endpoints are accessed via `api.php?endpoint=<name>` (or `/api/<name>` with URL rewriting). Public endpoints accept POST with JSON body. Admin endpoints require an active session.

| `check_block` | POST/GET | Check if an info hash is blocked |
| `submit_appeal` | POST | Submit a block/unblock appeal |
| `unsubscribe` | GET/POST | Unsubscribe from emails (GET = link click, POST = one-click) |
| `save_email_preferences` | POST | Save per-type notification preferences |
| `transparency` | GET | Get transparency page data |

### Admin Endpoints

All require active admin session. Prefix: `admin/`

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `admin/login` | POST | Authenticate |
| `admin/logout` | POST | End session |
| `admin/fetch_reports` | GET | Paginated reports (supports search, sort, filter) |

## Updating

For existing installations updating from an older version:

1. Back up your database and `config/` directory
2. Replace all files except the `config/` directory
3. Apply any pending migrations from `sql/` — they are data-only and safe to re-run:
   ```bash
   mysql -u <user> -p <database> < sql/2026-07-08_audit_settings.sql
   mysql -u <user> -p <database> < sql/2026-07-08_livesync_mode.sql
   mysql -u <user> -p <database> < sql/2026-07-09_opentracker_service.sql
   ```
   These add new settings keys (stats cache TTL, extra rate limits, session timeouts, trusted-proxy
   options, Live Syncs counter mode, and the OpenTracker service-restart options) with sensible
   defaults **without** overwriting anything you've customised. Then open **Admin → Settings** and
   review the new fields (in particular set **Tracker Statistics → Cache Lifetime / TTL** to ≥ your
   real upstream fetch time, and — if you want one-click restarts — **OpenTracker Service → Service
   name**; see [OpenTracker service restart](#opentracker-service-restart) for the sudoers rule).
4. The application will otherwise continue working — settings are stored in the database, not in files

There are **no schema (DDL) changes** in this update; every new option lives in the `settings` table.

> **Security housekeeping when updating:** remove any leftover `*.orig`/`*.bak` files (e.g. a stray
> `config/hash.txt.orig` would leak the admin password hash), delete `install.php` if present, and
> make sure `config/database.php` contains no plaintext credentials in comments.

## Troubleshooting

### Tracker stats stuck on "Syncing Swarms…" / never refresh
Almost always `config/` is not writable by the web-server user, and/or a stale runtime file was
uploaded from another machine. Symptoms in the API response (`?action=stats` → network tab, or the
raw `api.php?endpoint=tracker_stats&source=stats` JSON): `syncing_in_background: true` with a large
`lock_age`, and `cache_age` that keeps growing.

1. **Remove stale runtime files** on the server (they regenerate automatically):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/tracker
   rm -f config/stats_fetch.lock config/stats_cache.json \
         config/rate_limits.json config/login_attempts.json config/archive_*.marker
   ```
   A leftover `stats_fetch.lock` makes every visitor think a fetch is already in progress, so nobody
   ever triggers a new one — a permanent "Syncing Swarms…".
2. **Make `config/` writable by the web server** (see [Set Permissions](#3-set-permissions)):
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data config/ && sudo chmod 775 config/
   ```
   Quick check: `sudo -u www-data test -w config && echo WRITABLE || echo NOT-WRITABLE`.
3. Load `/?action=stats` and confirm a **fresh `config/stats_cache.json`** appears within a few
   seconds. If it does, you're fixed; if not, `config/` still isn't writable by PHP.
4. Make sure **Admin → Settings → Tracker Statistics → Cache Lifetime / TTL** is ≥ your real upstream
   fetch time (check `last_fetch_duration_ms` in the JSON — e.g. if fetches take ~25s, a TTL of 60–120s
   is fine; a TTL shorter than the fetch time causes constant re-syncing).

### Emails not sending
- Verify PHP `mail()` is working: `php -r "var_dump(mail('test@example.com', 'Test', 'Test'));"`
- Check your server's mail queue and MTA logs
- Ensure `site_email` is set in admin settings (used as From address)

### Blacklist file not updating
- Use the **Test** button in admin settings to verify path and permissions
- The PHP process user (e.g., `www-data`) must have read+write access
- On Linux: `sudo chown www-data:www-data /path/to/blacklist && sudo chmod 664 /path/to/blacklist`

### 500 errors or blank pages
- Check PHP error logs: `tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log`
- Ensure all required PHP extensions are installed: `php -m | grep -E "pdo_mysql|json|openssl|mbstring"`
- Verify `config/database.php` exists and contains valid credentials

### reCAPTCHA not appearing
- Ensure both Site Key and Secret Key are set in admin settings
- The reCAPTCHA widget is loaded in a modal overlay — it appears only when the Smart CAPTCHA threshold is reached
- Check browser console for loading errors
