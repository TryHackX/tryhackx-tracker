# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Require our tracker** for public registration (`whitelist_require_tracker`, `whitelist_tracker_hosts`):
  only magnet links whose `tr=` list points at one of the configured hosts (announce-URL hosts always
  count) are accepted; bare hashes are refused with an explanatory message. Off by default; admin adds
  and the S2S API are unaffected.
- Status page → *Block check* shows a second badge in whitelist mode: **Whitelisted / Not whitelisted**
  next to Blocked / Not Blocked.
- Admin: the *Whitelist* link moved from the Reload/Restart button group into the dashboard tabs row
  (no more accidental clicks next to Restart); Whitelist page uses the full width, fixed column widths
  (no wrapping / horizontal scrollbar), readable muted labels, pagination with First/Last and a
  page-number input.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-18

> **Whitelist mode.** Run OpenTracker with `-DWANT_ACCESSLIST_WHITE` and let the app own the
> accesslist: public registration, server-to-server API, admin Whitelist page, metadata worker.
> Upgrade = copy the files; the database upgrades itself on the first request
> (`settings.schema_version = 2`). Existing installations keep working unchanged in blacklist mode
> (`tracker_mode` defaults to `blacklist`). See README → *Whitelist mode* for the switch-over runbook.

### Added
- **Tracker mode** setting (`blacklist` | `whitelist`). Block/unblock from reports, appeals,
  restore and permanent delete now go through mode-aware helpers (`trackerBlockHash()` /
  `trackerUnblockHash()` / `isHashBlocked()` in `includes/whitelist.php`): in whitelist mode
  "block" = **ban** (hash removed from the served list and refused on registration), "unblock" =
  lift the ban.
- **Whitelist service** (`includes/whitelist.php`): DB is the source of truth (`whitelist`,
  `banned_hashes`), the accesslist file is appended for additions and **regenerated atomically**
  (temp file + `rename`, keyset pagination) for removals; refuses to write an EMPTY file
  (OpenTracker whitelist mode is fail-closed); SIGHUP reload is **debounced** (additions ≥ 45 s
  apart, removals/bans within 15 s, ≤ 12 reloads / 5 min because OpenTracker keeps superseded
  list generations for 5 minutes) with failure backoff; append and regeneration are serialised
  on one lock; a per-request janitor plus `tools/janitor.php` (systemd timer) fire pending work
  even without web traffic. Path safety: absolute, outside the web root, no `.php`/`.htaccess`
  names, no symlinks. `tools/whitelist_cli.php` for status / bulk add / regen / import.
- **Public registration page** `?action=whitelist`: one magnet link or 40-hex hash per line,
  CAPTCHA always required (registration is disabled — fail closed — when no CAPTCHA provider is
  configured), per-IP hourly submissions, per-IP and global daily caps (IPv6 counted per /64),
  duplicate / banned checks, registrant IP stored, per-item results with a generated magnet link
  and "active in ~N s", "check status" form (`whitelist_check`). Mode-aware public copy (home,
  info, terms, status page), nav link, `tracker.redirect_url` friendly.
- **Server-to-server API** `v1/whitelist/submit` / `v1/whitelist/ping` with
  `Authorization: Bearer key_id.secret` (only `sha256(secret)` is stored, shown once at creation);
  additive-only and idempotent; **any failed authentication with an Authorization header bans the
  source IP (v4 exact / v6 /64) for `api_ban_days` = 30** and stores the whole offending request
  (headers minus secrets, body up to 256 KB) for review; no-header requests get 401 without a
  ban; disabled keys 403 without a ban; `api_ban_exempt_ips` (seeded with the server's own
  addresses) are never banned; global insert throttle on ban rows. `tools/api_client_example.py`.
- **Admin Whitelist page** (`?action=admin-whitelist`, `assets/js/admin-whitelist.js` +
  shared `assets/js/admin-common.js`): status card (mode, file health, DB counts, pending reload,
  last reload, worker heartbeat, warnings; Regenerate / Reload / Import blacklist → bans), table
  with the multi-column sort stack, hash-prefix / IP / name / file-name search (FULLTEXT with LIKE
  fallback), source / metadata / banned filters, **Group by IP** with per-IP counts, bulk delete /
  ban / fetch-metadata, details modal (magnet generator with the tracker's announce URLs, name,
  size, collapsible file tree, seeders/leechers/completed via live OpenTracker scrape, source and
  forum reference, ban reason), Banned hashes view, API clients view (create → token shown once,
  enable/disable, rename, delete), API bans view (pretty-printed request snapshot, lift, manual
  ban). All dynamic DOM is built with `textContent`/`createElement` — torrent names, file paths
  and snapshots are attacker-controlled.
- **Metadata worker** (`worker/`): `python3-libtorrent` daemon under systemd (unprivileged
  `tracker` user, hardened unit, column-level MySQL grants) that resolves torrent name / size /
  file list through DHT + trackers in upload mode into `whitelist` / `whitelist_files`;
  heartbeat file shown in the panel; rows are queued by the panel or automatically for
  API/forum/admin additions.
- **CAPTCHA provider**: Google reCAPTCHA v2 or **Cloudflare Turnstile** (`captcha_provider`,
  `turnstile_site_key`, `turnstile_secret`), one shared modal `assets/js/captcha.js` (removed the
  three duplicated copies), generic `verifyCaptcha()` / `captchaTokenFromInput()` (accepts
  `captcha_token` and the legacy `g-recaptcha-response`), siteverify calls with hard timeouts,
  CSP updated for `challenges.cloudflare.com`.
- **Schema bootstrap** `includes/schema.php` (`ensureSchema()`, advisory-locked, idempotent,
  shared with `install.php`).
- `tools/opentracker/egress-budget/` — nftables egress budget for OpenTracker replies (whitelisted
  clients always pass, the unregistered swarm shares a packet-rate cap) + `tc prio` qdisc unit that
  sends everything except tracker replies first. Measured on a VPS whose hypervisor dropped ~50 % of
  all inbound packets while the tracker answered ~90k pps; README documents the measurements and why
  per-source-IP limits do not help against a diffuse swarm.
- `tools/opentracker/sighup-udp-workers.patch` — upstream OpenTracker spawns
  `listen.udp.workers` threads before it blocks SIGHUP, so `systemctl reload` could kill the
  process instead of reloading the list; the patch blocks the signals first.

### Changed
- `api.php` resolves the endpoint before `session_start()`; `v1/*` calls are stateless (no session
  cookie) and skip the report janitors. The whitelist janitor runs on every request (pollers
  included) — it is a single small state-file read.
- `getTrackerServiceWarnings()` reports whitelist health (empty/unwritable file, pending
  regeneration or reload, failed reloads, stale worker) instead of blacklist-change counts when in
  whitelist mode; `check_block` / `submit_report` answer with `whitelisted` in whitelist mode.
- Settings page: new **CAPTCHA** (provider + Turnstile keys), **Tracker Mode & Whitelist** and
  **Server-to-server API** sections; `save_settings.php` validates the new keys.
- Dashboard / Settings headers link to the Whitelist page.

### Fixed
- Metadata worker: torrents were added with libtorrent's default `paused` flag while being taken out
  of the queue manager (`auto_managed` cleared), so they never connected to any peer and every fetch
  timed out; both flags are cleared now (86/86 forum hashes failed before, 116/160 resolve within
  seconds after). DHT bootstrap moved to the `dht_bootstrap_nodes` session setting.
- `removeHashFromBlacklist()` now writes a temp file and `rename()`s it — the previous in-place
  truncate could let OpenTracker observe an empty blacklist during a reload.

### Security
- Review fixes before release: API ban snapshots never store a credential value (only the scheme and
  the 16-hex key id of a well-formed bearer token); an authenticated client with an oversized body
  gets 413 instead of a 30-day ban; `getClientIp()` walks `X-Forwarded-For` from the right and skips
  trusted proxies (the left-most, client-supplied hop was trusted before — spoofable exempt IPs /
  rate-limit keys); IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`) are unmapped before bucketing so
  they no longer all share one `::/64` ban / rate-limit bucket; `.htaccess` passes the Authorization
  header through to php-fpm/CGI; whitelist regeneration verifies every write and the final size and
  refuses to install a truncated file; `validateWhitelistPath()` no longer treats the CLI's cwd as the
  document root; IN(...) lookups are chunked (65 535-placeholder limit on bulk CLI adds); plain names
  from the API are no longer URL-decoded twice; the Settings page gained the missing
  **Server-to-server API** section (`api_enabled`, `api_ban_days`, `api_ban_exempt_ips`).
- Bearer secrets stored hashed; API bans keyed per IPv6 /64; JSON responses/snapshots use
  `JSON_INVALID_UTF8_SUBSTITUTE`; whitelist path restrictions; admin whitelist UI free of
  `innerHTML` interpolation; forum reference links only for `http(s)` URLs with `rel="noopener"`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Automatic blacklist reload (SIGHUP).** After every panel action that changes the blacklist file
  (accept report → block, accept appeal, unblock, restore report to active, permanent delete) the app
  now runs `systemctl reload <service>` — a SIGHUP that makes OpenTracker re-read its white/blacklist
  **without downtime**. Best-effort and non-fatal; on success it clears the pending-change tracking.
  Toggle with the new **Auto-reload blacklist** setting (`opentracker_auto_reload`, default on).
- **Reload button** in the Dashboard header (password-confirmed, with a confirm modal like Restart)
  and a matching `admin/reload_tracker` endpoint.
- **Permission Test buttons** in Settings for both restart and reload (`admin/test_tracker_permission`).
  They run a read-only `sudo -n -l` check — never restarting or reloading anything — and print
  copy-paste sudoers fixes when a rule is missing.

### Fixed
- **Restore to active now really unblocks.** Restoring an archived, blocked report to active set the
  database to unblocked but left the info hash in the blacklist file, so the tracker kept blocking it.
  It is now removed from the blacklist file (when nothing else keeps that hash blocked) and the tracker
  is reloaded.

### Notes
- New re-runnable, data-only migration: `sql/2026-07-14_opentracker_reload.sql`.
- For reload, add a `systemctl reload` sudoers rule and an `ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID` line to
  the unit — see [OpenTracker service reload & restart](README.md#opentracker-service-reload--restart).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-09

First public release.

### Features
- Public site: abuse/DMCA report submission (magnet → info-hash extraction), report-status
  lookup, block check, appeal system, transparency page, configurable ToS.
- Admin panel: sortable/searchable/paginated dashboard, report workflow (pending → reviewed →
  blocked/archived), inline editing, appeal management with auto-close, auto-archiving.
- Blacklist integration with a newline-separated hash file, with path/permission testing.
- **OpenTracker service control**: optional one-click `systemctl restart` of the tracker
  service (password-confirmed) plus smart, stacking restart recommendations (orange/red) driven
  by pending blacklist changes since boot and by uptime thresholds.
- Tracker statistics with a shared, TTL'd server-side cache and configurable Live Syncs counter.
- Email system: submission/under-review/status/appeal notifications, per-type preferences,
  RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe.
- Donations with up to 15 custom fields (backward-compatible with legacy BTC/ETH/XMR settings).

### Security
- CSRF on all writes, per-IP login lockout + rate limiting, admin session idle/absolute timeouts,
  bcrypt password hashing, HMAC-signed unsubscribe tokens, prepared statements throughout,
  strict output escaping, per-directory `.htaccess` protection (Nginx equivalents documented),
  reverse-proxy-aware client IP resolution, and no secrets committed to source.

### Notes
- All configuration lives in the database `settings` table and is managed from the web UI.
- Database changes ship as re-runnable, data-only migrations under `sql/` — see the
  [Updating](README.md#updating) section.
